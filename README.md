## Overview

### Screenshot
**Desktop**

**Mobile**

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use the flexbox layout model to center elements both vertically and horizontally. I also practiced using CSS custom properties to manage colors and spacing consistently throughout the project.

### Continued development

I want to continue improving my skills with CSS Grid and responsive design techniques. I also plan to explore more advanced CSS features like animations and transitions to enhance user experience.
